NOTE FOR FUTURE ME: 
    1. Few Mistakes in the initial files, added div when there were no need and made some other small mistakes. Read the files carefully.
    2. Not using a lot of tags does not break anything but they should be used for convention.

PROBLEMS FACED:
    1. alerts after images shows alerts over image [both are separated by different bodies] [but having alert before image does not cause this problem]
        - reason: default bootstrap behavior
        - solution: use fixed-bottom class
    2. grouped buttons are inline and wants to say in a row
        - reason: no clue
        - unsolved [div will most likely fix it]
    3. refer to dropdownmenu.html, not using li for specifying list item does not break anything
        - reason: html shenanigans??
        - solution: even though li is not needed, it should still be used, mostly for convention
    4. could not build collapsible navigation bar, will attempt it soon. w3schools does not have it or have it wrong.
    5. check carousel.html. if picture fails to load then the left right direction buttons also fails.
        - reason: because buttons are printed over the carousel images?
        - unsolved
    6. extension of problem 5, carousel.html behaves responsively unless site is minimized too much then the 
       carousel pictures return to their full size.
        - reason: NO CLUE
        - unsolved
