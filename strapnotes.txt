NOTE FOR FUTURE ME: 
    1. Few Mistakes in the initial files, added div when there were no need and made some other small mistakes. Read the files carefully.
    2. Not using a lot of tags does not break anything but they should be used for convention.

PROBLEMS FACED:
    1. alerts after images shows alerts over image [both are separated by different bodies] [but having alert before image does not cause this problem]
        - reason: default bootstrap behavior
        - solution: use fixed-bottom class
    2. grouped buttons are inline and wants to say in a row
        - reason: no clue
        - WILL FIND SOLUTIONS LATER [div will most likely fix it]
    3. refer to dropdownmenu.html, not using li for specifying list item does not break anything
        - reason: html shenanigans??
        - WILL FIND SOLUTIONS LATER
